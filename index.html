        <p class="lead mb-4">When I went to the Jinzhai County Vocational Education School, I did not go with the group, but went spontaneously. It took the teacher and another student to help the children in poor areas and it took 4~5 days. After reaching the hour, I arrived in the mountains and noticed the people in that place in advance. So they met us with expectations and they had two weeks of experience. I learned about their customs and habits, and experienced the feeling of walking for one hour each day when they went to school. They taught them to play basketball, mathematics, and English.

        In summer of 2018, I participated in a youth leadership development program initiated by Industrial and Commercial Bank of China (ICBC) for heirs of big customers. At the beginning, I was excited to take study tours to industry tycoons such as Black Rock and Bloomberg where I learned how to use Bloomberg Terminal for financial information enquiry. Then, we were divided into groups to handle different financial cases for more practice. Ambitious enough, I assumed the role of team leader in our assigned project to design a portfolio. To ease the burden of other members, I proactively embarked upon the section of non-standardized credit assets management since itâ€™s not as familiar as other financial vehicles. Under this condition, I researched a lot on trust loans, entrusted creditorâ€™s rights, bankersâ€™ acceptance bills, equity-based financing with buy-back clauses. Within the limited time, I organized and gave a final touch to all the slides, even helped other members with their presentation rehearsal. Our efforts paid off in the final report: we stood out among all the groups and our team received recognition from the portfolio analysts and other professionals. Further, in the summit, I prepared a topic focusing on how financial products outperform homogeneous ones and my presentation led me to an honor of Outstanding Participant. This experience was rewarding and immensely instructive, and this also brought me a valuable opportunity to work with talents from different social backgrounds and learn from them. More importantly, I value teamwork in solving problems and fulfilling tasks. Being a leader, more than must-have skills such as planning, organizing, leading and controlling managers should possess, I have learnt to capitalize on each personâ€™s uniqueness as a tremendously powerful tool.

        To apply my knowledge of computer science in field practice, I searched for job opportunities at an Internet and E-commerce company. Working as a business analyst intern at BaoZun E-commerce in Shanghai, I encountered a challenge to drive business intelligence from disorderly data sets for a client company. Due to my previous experience, I used Excel for data analysis which however cannot meet the needs of this case because I have never handled multiple databases in a time including clientâ€™s E-commerce platform, social media matrix, and Customer Relation Management (CRM). To navigate the challenge, I need to solve two major problems. The first problem for me was how to synergize different databases. Hence, I learned Relational Database and MySQL to cleanse invalid data and organize useful items to be explicitly specified as accessible attributes. The other one was data modeling. For this problem, my line manager offered me great help in guiding me to use Python as a means of modeling for analysis. Eventually, I figured the two problems out and helped the senior analysts for the report. Motivated by this experience, I found computer science as a foundation for every walks of life to facilitate the analytical process and calculation. Specifically, it has been a great leverage for my study as well. In solving my mathematical problems, I would develop a program for more efficient calculation; while in research, I relied on a programming operation system for data modeling and quantitative analysis. At these points, my interest in taking an undergraduate program in this field grows to a large extent.</p>
